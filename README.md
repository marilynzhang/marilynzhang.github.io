# Personal Website
https://marilynzhang.github.io/


Work in progress website. Template from colorlib. At some point, I'd like to finish the website that I'd started.

To-Dos for the future:
- implement responsive website design
- change background picture to Amsterdam bridge picture 
- finish filling in the rest of the sections
- books section! Guns Germs and Steel, Spirit Catches you and you fall, When Breath Becomes Air, All The Light We Cannot See, Every Note Played
- further change the heading fonts so that they're sans serif
